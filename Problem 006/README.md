# Sum square difference X²

- The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is: *1²+2²+...+10² = 385*

- The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is: *(1+2+...+10)² = 55² = 385*

- Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is: *3025 - 385 = 2640*
