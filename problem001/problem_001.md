# Problem
if we list all the natural numbers below $10$ that are multiples of $3$ or $5$, we get $3, 5, 6$ and $9$. The sum of these multiples is $23$.
Find the sum of all the multiples of $3$ or $5$ below $1000$

---

# Solution
There are some inference on the problem, such as, we don't need to start from 1 till 1000, we can already start the loop from the value 6. If we consider that there are no values below 6 that are multiple of 3 or 5, except themselves, we can get some performance from that
