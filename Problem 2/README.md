# Problem 2

### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

### By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

For this specific problem i used a recurssion algorithm, but if i only used this algorithm it would be incredibly slow, therefore i used a tool from the module: functools. The tool i used was lru_cache which is used to store the values from the functions to make it faster.

## IMPORTANT
For the sake of demonstration, i only used the fibonacci sequence until it's 50th term
